# AWS Serverless Chat App
I wanted to explore AWS and the services it has to offer.  I ended up creating a basic chat application that allows users to chat within their web browser.  It mimics Facebook Messenger or Slack

## Note: This is a current work in progress

## Technologies

* AWS S3 - Hosts the basic site
* AWS Lambda - Processes the logic and communication with various connected AWS services 
* DynamoDB - Stores the messages on, letting the users to update and create data, as well read previous messages
* Cognite - Allows the user to create custom usernames and passwords 
* IAM - Used to handle policies and roles for each connected AWS service
